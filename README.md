# AutoEmailApplier
Tired of constantly sending the same emails to different companies to apply for them? Seeing how they use automation to filter us, I say we do the same with this, The AutoEmailApplier, just save a template into the source code, and fill up the blanks in the form and send. You can also attach pdfs such as your resume or cover letter, or both :D
