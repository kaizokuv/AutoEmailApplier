# AutoEmailApplier
Tired of constantly sending the same emails to different companies to apply for them? Seeing how they use automation to filter us, I say we do the same with this, The AutoEmailApplier, just save a template into the source code, and fill up the blanks in the form and send. You can also attach pdfs such as your resume or cover letter, or both :D

The main idea of this is simple, we make a script in Python that helps us automate the tediousness of constantly rewriting the same thing over and over and over again for different companies. This ReadMe will include how the code works, screenshots and how to change stuff so you can add and remove stuff. If there's anything you need help with don't feel shy to reach out to me via my email and I'll help best i can.

# How the code works
First up is the template. The code has the template I personally use to reach out to companies and get a conversation going between me and the company.

You can see parts like such as {your_name} or {company_name}. Those are the parts you will fill up in the form. The template can be changed according to your liking, just make sure that the formattings for the parts you have to fill up are using the curly brackets {}.

Next up is the formatting. This is the part of the code that will specify what you have to fill up when you get the form later on. By default the program will ask you to fill up a number of things, these are tailored to my needs for an internship but you can change them as you please. This includes the following:
- Company Name
- Your Name
- Your Course
- Your University Name
- Your Phone Number
- Your Email Address

Adding more formattings will increase the complexity but make the email more detailed and tailored to you.

From there we have the subject, will grab the first line of the template and remove the word 'Subject' as to avoid duplication. So the default subject of any email you send with this program will "Subject: Internship Application â€“ IT/Cybersecurity Position at {company_name}".

Following this is the structure. This includes the subject of the email, your email, the company's email (which you will also input later on) and the main email itself.

Next up is the attachments. This is where you can edit the attachments such as pdfs or word documents. These can be added by adding the file paths into the specified section. If you wish to add more just continue on so.

If there is something wrong with one of the files the program will automatically skip them.

Next is the connection to the Gmail services, this is so that the program can have the ability to send emails on behalf of the clients Gmail. So far this program is for Gmail users only, but I will update it soon to include all gmails, including cooperate email domains.

Going forward will be the explainations for the GUI. First up is the data collection for variables such as the user's gmail, company email address, so on so forth. By default the program comes with these fields to fill:
- Your Gmail Address
- Your Gmail App Password
- Your Name
- Your Course
- Your University Name
- Your Phone Number
- Company Name
- Company Email Address

Below is the window design. Using a loop to design the frame as well as the boxes to hold the title. In addition anything that gets typed into the Password box will be replaced with an astrisk (*) for the sake of user privacy. The full build can be seen below.

Finally is the links near the submission button. For now it has two, for those who need help with App Passwords (it's a hassle I know but for security reasons it's needed). If you need to add more, make sure the names for the "_label" and "_link" are different. This way it won't get overlapped with any of the old links.

Enjoy my little program :D
