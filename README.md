# AutoEmailApplier
Tired of constantly sending the same emails to different companies to apply for them? Seeing how they use automation to filter us, I say we do the same with this, The AutoEmailApplier, just save a template into the source code, and fill up the blanks in the form and send. You can also attach pdfs such as your resume or cover letter, or both :D

The main idea of this is simple, we make a script in Python that helps us automate the tediousness of constantly rewriting the same thing over and over and over again for different companies. This ReadMe will be split into afew sections, how the code works, screenshots and how to change stuff so you can add and remove stuff.

# How the code works
First up is the template. The code has the template I personally use to reach out to companies and get a conversation going between me and the company.
